# UW Coursework
This repository contains personal solutions to homeworks and exams taken at the University of Washington. Solutions are provided with no guarantees to their accuracy. Many of the LaTeX files may not compile properly as the dependencies have changed over time. 

Any time MATLAB code was provided for an assignment, I ported it to Python (Numpy/Scipy). This may be of particular use for future students in courses where MATLAB is used frequently.

As I upload files I am going through them to standardize formatting and correct errors which I made when submitting my assignments. In general I am relying on grader feedback for this, so there are likely additional errors. Feel free to mark these as issues in github and they will be corrected.

 ### Note on Academic Integrity
Copying solutions from any source is not only detrimental to your own learning, but is plagarism. Don't do this. If you do end up looking up a solution, cite your source when writing up your assingment.

I have provided these questions and solutions so in the hopes that they can be used for reference when preparing for exams, and as practice problems/additional problems for self study.
