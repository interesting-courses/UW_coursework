# UW Coursework
This repository contains personal solutions to homeworks and exams taken at the University of Washington. Solutions are provided with no guarantees to their accuracy. Many of the LaTeX files may not compile properly as the dependencies have changed over time. 

Any time MATLAB code was provided for an assignment, I ported it to Python (Numpy/Scipy). This may be of particular use for future students in these courses.

At the current time I have not corrected any of my solutions, even if there are known errors. Feel free to mark errors as issues on github. I will ~ eventually ~ get around to fixing errors and making the TeX files more uniform.

 ### Note on Academic Integrity
Copying solutions from any source is not only detrimental to your own learning, but is plagarism. Don't do this. If you do end up looking up a solution, cite your source when writing up your assingment.

I have provided these questions and solutions so in the hopes that they can be used for reference when preparing for exams, and as practice problems/additional problems for self study.
